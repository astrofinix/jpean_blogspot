      Being able to take care of it is one of the best forms of self-love we can
      do for ourselves. Further, improving bit by bit is key in creating large
      changes and appreciation with your body.<br /><br />
      Here are four main components from which you can improve: your skincare
      routine, showering habits, sleep, and exercise. <br /><br />Here are the
      following easy to follow tips that I have learned from reading medical
      journals, and following medical practitioners to guide you, from which
      they have guided me into building my own routine.
    </div>
    <div class="section3 content">
      <span class="h1">1.1. Skincare Routine</span><br /><br />

      <i>General Rule of Thumb </i> <br /><br />I will not list the exact
      products I use but only the <i>active ingredients</i> that are on it. This
      is to ensure you find a product that works for you and simplify your
      routine away from being too complex. I recommend Skin Carisma and INCI
      Decoder for checking the safety and effectiveness of products you use and
      you consider buying. These two sites have one of the reputable sources for
      both really ineffective and highly effective skincare products.
      <br /><br />Also, expensive does not always mean effective, the simpler
      your routine is the better it is.<br /><br />
      Simply put, this routine is for morning:
      <ol>
        <li>Cleanser</li>
        <li>Sunscreen</li>
        <li>Spot Treatment (optional)</li>
      </ol>
      And, this is for evening:
      <ol>
        <li>Cleanser</li>
        <li>Retinol</li>
        <li>Spot Treatment (optional)</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <b>Cleanser</b><br /><br />
      Everyday, our skin is constantly bombarded with dirt, sweat, and
      pollutants so cleansing it twice a day, morning and evening, is vital in
      maintaining the healthy look of it. Ingredients to consider are
      <i>vitamin C, ceramides, retinol, salicylic acid,and glycerin </i>among
      others. <br /><br /><b>Day: Sunscreen</b><br /><br />
      This is by far what dermatologists strongly advise to always use when
      going outside even if it's a cloudy day. Sunscreen protects the skin from
      premature aging and adding to that there is no such thing as a healthy
      tan. Dermatologists stress that tanning is a way for the skin to protect
      itself by destroying it, and mostly one of the leading risks of it is skin
      cancer. <br /><br />As a rule of thumb a good sunscreen has both SPF30+
      and PA+++ or better (SPF 50 & PA++++).<br /><br />
      For PA+++, it protects the skin from UVB rays, these rays are still
      present even on cloudy days. <br /><br />For SPF, it protects the skin
      from UVA rays, these rays are the one responsible for having a tan and are
      most powerful on a clear day. <br /><br /><b>Night: Retinol</b
      ><br /><br />
      Retinol and its derivatives like retinoic acid unclogs pores, is a potent
      anti-aging product that reduces fine lines and any signs of premature
      aging <br /><br /><i>Moisturizer? Should you use one?</i> <br /><br />In
      hot and humid climates, like the Philippines, moisturizer is not essential
      since the skin barrier automatically absorbs water in the atmosphere.
      However, moisturizer will be needed if someone is prone to dry skin or
      lives in a cold climate, like Baguio. This is because since the air is not
      humid, thus, no water the skin does not trap water, but rather releases
      it. Therefore, a moisturizer is needed to trap it and preserve the skin
      barrier, which gives the skin a plush and healthy look. <br /><br /><b
        >Spot treatments</b
      >
      <br /><br />These are a product recommendation for treating specific skin
      concerns which have specialized ingredients. <br /><br />For acne,
      <i>erythromycin</i> is a good antibacterial in treating it, as well as
      <i>benzoyl peroxide</i>. <br /><br />For blackheads and whiteheads,
      <i>salicylic acid</i> is a powerful ingredient that deeply cleans the
      pores and declogs it of debris. <br /><br />For light chemical peeling,
      which renews your skin, a peeling solution is applied once a week
      containing AHA/BHA acids such as
      <i>lactic, glycolic, mandelic, and salicylic acid</i> helps in overall
      cell turnover, revealing new and youthful skin.

    <div class="section4 content">
      <span class="h1"> 1.2. Showering </span><br /><br />
      Now, the following may cause some debate but doing the bare minimum for
      yourself of showering is more than enough. Moreover, if you are sweaty
      from an intense activity like an exercise, or just have a bad odor from
      the day, that simply calls for a shower. But if you just did no sweat, and
      just no smell, there's no mandatory rule to shower.
      <br /><br />Furthermore, a 4-5 minute of showering with focus on cleaning
      your groin and armpit area will be as good as cleaning your whole body.
      Moreover, having fine hair, or simply having itchy scalp calls for
      shampooing, if not, or just having more curly hair, you can just go by not
      showering. Just in general, listen to your body and what it needs, briefer
      or lesser times of showering does not mean it's not as good as showering
      frequently.
    </div>
    <div class="section5 content">
      <span class="h1">1.3. Sleep</span><br /><br />
      Sleep is powerful. And perhaps, the one that is being left for granted the
      most. Mastering your sleep and clearing some misconceptions from it is key
      in creating a good, and restful sleep. <br /><br />Now, 7-8 hours of sleep
      is just average but it's not for everyone. Every person has different
      lengths of sleep where they feel well rested. Here are the three questions
      to assess whether the length and quality of your sleep is just fine:
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>Do you feel really rested during the day?</li>
        <li>Can you not fall asleep involuntarily during the day?</li>
        <li>
          Do you generally fall asleep through the night without disturbances?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />If you answer all three, then your length of sleep is just enough
      and suits you. If not, it is a very good time to pinpoint some hindrances
      keeping you from it? Here are key tips in improving your sleep:<br /><br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cool resting place - pre-cooling your bed is key in making you fall
          asleep faster
        </li>
        <li>
          Silent and tranquil environment - find a place that you can fully
          relax away from any disturbances or noise
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep away Phones and Gadgets in Bed - doing this in your bed creates
          an association with it to stay awake. This association ruins your
          intention of ever falling asleep in your bed. Make sure to make it as
          hard for you to bring your phone/gadgets in your bed. Locking it out
          in place, or simply putting your phone in bedtime mode and keeping it
          as far away from your bed will make you regain control of your
          association with your bed for resting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Writing up in a Diary/Taking Note - sometimes our mind wanders around
          and makes us unsettle our thoughts. Simply journaling and taking note
          of these thoughts help in calming ourselves down, and we can go back
          to these thoughts in the morning when we are well-rested.
        </li>
        <li>
          Therapy - If there are things way beyond the remedy recommended here,
          it is best to consult a health professional to help you get rested. A
          therapy has been proven to effectively help people with chronic
          trouble in falling asleep (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <i>Want to Easily Wake Up? Time your sleep.</i><br /><br />
      Do you wanna easily wake up to your alarm? Then, with your length of
      sleep, consider the timing of when you sleep. A whole sleep cycle lasts
      for 1.5 hours, and this website, SleepoPolis, recommends some specific
      time when you should fall asleep. This timing accounts when your sleep
      cycle ends, so that when your alarm hits off, you will easily be awake. Do
      take note to have a 30 minutes before the recommended time so that by the
      recommended timing your sleep cycle is already starting. <br /><br /><i

      ><br /><br />
      Have you ever dreaded or hated hearing your alarm? Maybe consider subtle
      alarm sounds that do not really put you on high alert. It is recommended
      that you use pleasing tones so that you do not activate your fight/flight
      mode. This mode is usually associated with panic, distress, and overall
      unpleasant feeling such as annoyance.

      <span class="h1">1.4. Exercising </span><br /><br />
      It is recommended to have at least a total of 150 minutes of moderate
      activity per week. But breaking this number down, it doesn't have to be a
      single session, but can be 5 days with a 30-minute exercise, which makes
      this doable, and you can further modify it to your liking.<br /><br />
      Here are types of exercises arranged at increasing difficulty and from
      which you can find what suits you. Remember, go at your own pace (~Adele).
      <br /><br /><b>Tai chi</b> <br /><br />Who said exercising has to be
      really intensive? This exercise was assigned to us in a school report, and
      it is recommended for people who prefer a type of meditative and light
      exercise. It is practiced through a controlled sequence of body movements
      specifically of the hands and feet. These are the two channels that I
      recommended to my mother when she was trying this herself:

      ><br /><br /><b>Walking</b><br /><br />
      Who knew? Just consistent everyday walks and this helps your body to stay
      healthy. <br /><br /><b>Yoga</b> <br /><br />I have attempted trying yoga
      but my joints have proven me otherwise. If you are already flexible
      yourself, yoga may fit just right for you. Although, I did not stick to
      this exercise, I incorporated some of it in my workout for my stretches
      and warm up. Here are some creators, I followed which helped me started
      it:

      and

      <br /><br /><b>Running/jogging</b><br /><br />
      For each week, this is the app I have been using to time myself and track
      how far I have jogged. For each day, 5 times a week, I target at least 3km
      run; at an average I complete it in less than 30 minutes. [<a

      >] <br /><br /><b>Workout</b><br /><br />
      Perhaps, what comes first in mind when we talk of exercises are workout,
      and sometimes starting sudden and big goals is quite discouraging in
      keeping this routine long term. <br /><br />The main key to ever
      maintaining not just working out but to every routine mentioned here:
      first start easy, doing doable and simple starts is key in keeping the
      ball rolling. Moreover, maintaining this routine on a day that you don't
      feel like doing your routine, know that there are days that this will
      happen away from enthusiastic motivation. Doing just a bit of it is key in
      creating continuous improvements. Know that you are doing your best, and
      each day's best is different from another. The main idea here is you don't
      have to fully deliver everyday, just do what you can. Because keeping
      these incremental changes is way more important than pressuring yourself
      with high unrealistic goals which you will just suddenly stop when you are
      discouraged from doing it.<br /><br />Start from beginner exercise, and
      increment the difficulty of each exercise. Here is the app I have been
      using right now,
      <a
        href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=homeworkout.homeworkouts.noequipment&hl=en&gl=US"
        class="default_link"
        >Home Workouts</a
      >
      <br /><br />At first, it was hard starting in the beginner exercises, and
      just feels impossible to ever complete it. Now, I am on the advanced part
      of my workout and I have been enjoying it ever since I started to see my
      progression.

      <span class="h1">TL; DR (Too Long; Didn't Read.)</span><br /><br />
      Self-love doesn't have to be elaborate nor complex. These are the tips to
      simply amp your self-care routine.<br /><br />
      For your skincare routine, a cleanser, sunscreen and retinol routine will
      just do magic on you. Focus on active ingredients with your skincare
      products will be just as effective than having a long and detailed
      routine. <br /><br />For showering, a quick 4-5 minute shower with focus
      on cleaning your groin and armpit area is just good enough in keeping your
      body clean. The Frequency of it highly depends on you, are you active?
      Going sweaty? Gets body odor easily? A quick shower will help you manage
      those. <br /><br />For sleep, make sure you have a cool, quiet resting
      place, you can consider taking notes/journal to calm your thoughts,
      putting away your gadgets in your bed or notching up your alarm can all
      contribute to well-rested sleep. <br /><br />For exercising, you can
      choose to start with either Tai-chi, walking, yoga, running/jogging or
      exercise. You can go at your own pace in completing a total 150 minutes of
      moderate physical activity per week.
